Steps for machine learning
1. Import the data.
2. Clean the data.
3. Split the data into training/test sets
4. Create a model
5. Train the model
6. Make predictions
7. Evaluate and Improve

LIBRARIES
Numpy - provides a multi-dimensional array
Pandas - Data analysis library that provides data frame( similar to excel spreadsheet)
MatPlotLib - 2D plotting library for creating graphs and plots
Scikit-Learn - Provides common algorithms such as decision trees, and neural networks, etc.

TOOLS
Jupyter - used for writing code for machine learning. Makes it eay to inspect the data.
